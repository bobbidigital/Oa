{"name":"Project Bullhorn","tagline":"Communicate your changes effectively","body":"### Bottom Up Communications.\r\nThe problem with change management is most often notification. [Configuration Management Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management_database) solutions tend to have awesome options, but fail to represent the reality of large enterprises. Systems have multiple uses, multiple names and business partners are generally unaware of how a single system impacts the entirety of their solution. Project Bullhorn s an attempt to address some of these issues.\r\n\r\n### How Does It Work?\r\nProject Bullhorn tries to solve this by representing devices in your solution and adding metadata style tagging. This allows a single device, whether it be a server, a network switch or a printer, to be represented in unlimited ways. Users can then 'subscribe' to any number of tags in the system. Whenever a change event is entered, the system generates a tree of tags that are impacted by the change. Anyone subscribed to any of the impacted tags gets notified that a change that impacts their system has been entered.\r\n\r\n### How Is This Different?\r\nTypically change management notifications are pushed out to business partners through a central system. But the problem is that the onus of the change notification and contact is on the project or change manager. With Bullhorn, the paradigm is shifted so that users are responsible for managing the applications and notifications they receive. This will (hopefully) spurn a larger sense of engagement and ownership from business users and partners.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBullhorn was written by [Jeff Smith](http://www.allthingsdork.com). The inspiration came from problems encountered at a previous job and the company's struggle with change management communications.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
