Oa
==
##Purpose##

Oa/Bullhorn was designed with the idea of creating bottom up commmunication in an organization. With Oa you can create Nodes which contain metadata properties. 
These metadata properties are then used/associated with events that occur in your environment. Creating an event and using the appropriate tags will trigger
notifications to users who have registered to be notified for events involving tags. It also will allow reporting by users to see which users are registered
for specific tags.

##Status##
Oa is currently still in development and is missing key features. Development is still active.
